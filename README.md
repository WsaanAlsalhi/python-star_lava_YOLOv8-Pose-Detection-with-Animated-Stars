- Uses YOLOv8-pose model for fast and accurate human detection.
- Custom five-pointed stars with warm glowing colors.
- Animated falling stars that avoid human figures in real time.
- Fullscreen visual display for immersive experience.

##  Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- [Ultralytics YOLO](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics)
